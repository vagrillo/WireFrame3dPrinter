# 3D Wireframe Printer

## Project Overview

The 3D Wireframe Printer is a unique project aimed at creating a 3D printer capable of producing wireframe structures with two key components. The first component focuses on printing spherical connection "joints," while the second component is responsible for cutting and shaping various segments that will be connected using the joints.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

1. **Wireframe Printing**: Develop a 3D printing process capable of creating wireframe structures, where the primary emphasis is on the design and production of spherical joints.

2. **Spherical Joints**: Create a component within the 3D printer that specializes in printing spherical connection joints. These joints will be integral to assembling the wireframe structure.

3. **Segment Cutting and Shaping**: Implement a second component in the printer dedicated to cutting and shaping segments that will connect to the spherical joints. This component ensures precise measurements and smooth edges.

4. **Modularity**: Design the wireframe printer to be modular, allowing for customization of the size and complexity of the wireframe structures to be created.

5. **User-Friendly Interface**: Develop an intuitive user interface that simplifies the process of configuring and printing wireframe designs.

6. **Materials Compatibility**: Ensure the printer is compatible with a variety of materials suitable for wireframe construction, including plastics, metals, and composites.

7. **Scalability**: Enable the printer to scale up or down in size to accommodate different project requirements.

## How to Use

Detailed instructions on how to use the 3D Wireframe Printer can be found in the accompanying user manual. However, here's a general overview:

1. **Assemble the Printer**: Follow the assembly instructions to set up the 3D Wireframe Printer, ensuring that both the joint-printing and segment-cutting components are correctly installed.

2. **Design Your Wireframe**: Use 3D modeling software to design the wireframe structure you wish to create. Ensure that the design includes spherical joints and segmented connections.

3. **Load Materials**: Load the chosen printing material into the printer. Make sure to use the correct materials for both the joint and segment components.

4. **Configure Settings**: Input the necessary parameters into the printer's user interface, specifying the size and intricacy of your wireframe design.

5. **Print**: Initiate the printing process, and the 3D Wireframe Printer will start fabricating the spherical joints and cutting the segments according to your design.

6. **Assembly**: Once the printing process is complete, assemble the wireframe structure by connecting the spherical joints with the pre-cut segments.

7. **Fine-Tuning**: Perform any necessary adjustments to ensure the wireframe structure is stable and aligned properly.
